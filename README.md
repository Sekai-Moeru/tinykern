- What is this?
  A building configuration for the Linux kernel with almost every option stripped out, except for TTY and ELF binary support.
- Why?
  To make the smallest possible Linux kernel.
- And, why is that?
  Because, why not? And, possibly to build a small, live diagnostics Linux distribution.
- I can't find the configuration!
  Well, it's in the repo.
